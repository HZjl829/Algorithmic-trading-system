 Algorithmic Trading System

A compact research framework that designs, back-tests, and evaluates factor-based equity portfolios.

## Highlights
- **Multi-model return forecasts** — OLS, adaptive LASSO, best-subset selection, and 5-factor PCA run on a rolling 60-month window to generate expected returns & covariances.
- **Portfolio engines** — equal-weight benchmark, turnover-aware mean-variance, robust mean-variance, and convex risk-parity allocators with semi-annual rebalancing.
- **Built-in KPIs** — Sharpe ratio, turnover, draw-down, and wealth-curve plotting for quick strategy comparison.
